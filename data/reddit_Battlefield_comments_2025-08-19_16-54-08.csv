Attack Helicopters. Holy shit what have you done DICE? Looking at comments in other places people dont seem to like 2042 Heli controls, Me personally I had no issues with them, they felt like I could manouver them well and do some cool tricks and aim accuratley. The attack helicopter in 6 feels like im flying an absolute brick, with sensitivity punched way up it only helps slightly, Yaw is nigh on non existant and the accerleration/speed is so ridiculous that your pitch so screwed that you either cant pull up at all or if you are trying to do an attack run you end up going nose first into the ground at the slightest tilt down of the nose. These controls are awful, the worst helicopter controls I've ever seen in a battlefield game. Whats with the rockets as well and aiming them? are you meant be eaiming for inbetween the two lines? the dot in the middle of the lines? because the rockets you fire dont track accuratley to either of them at all and seem to curve? are they smart rockets? they cant be that smart because they cant hit shit.

On both ground vehicles and Helicopters WASD also just dont seem to work well? Using the Abrahms or IFV there has been a fair few occasions where W or S + A or D just dosnt seem to work and they also seem to do nothing in the helicopter beyond making it fly at Mach 10 with W.

Gunplay is ok. But it doesn't feel exceptional. TTK is weird. I need to empty mags to kill but it feels like I get absolutely destroyed a lot of times, ie. I die extremely quickly.

Air vehicles feels bad to maneuver. Very floaty.

Tanks feel heavy, but not really that powerful. And there are too few of them. The number kind of fits the current map size, but I would rather see maps being a bit bigger to fit more vehicles. 

Then there's the UI. There's just too much going on. The outlines of friendlies through walls just annoy me. And I want a list of my squad in the deployment screen to see all their classes quickly so I myself can select an appropriate class.

Graphics are nice, but feels a little bit grainy. Could be my settings. Running everything on ultra with a 4090 and performance is great. I have some graphical glitches but it's not too bad.

Overall a massive step up from 2042, and it's only early beta. Haven't decided wether I will buy it on release day. We'll see.

Update: After playing some more I feel like the maps really just lack character. The city maps are just a maze of alleyways and hallways. And the capture points are so forgettable.

Gunplay is too fast and without impact. When I shoot I can barely tell if I'm hitting, and when getting shot it's the same. Shooting is too floaty. Grenade throw is instantaneous. TTK is too fast. Too many movement options, I got corner killed by a jump shooter. This is literally a CoD movement tech, why is it here? The gunplay+movement combination make it feel too arcadey.

Sound design is generic and doesn't make the weapons feel powerful, how did we go from BF1 sound design to this audio soup? In BF1 footsteps are very clear, well positioned, well detailed. In BF6 I get rushed all the time and never hear anything. 

The overall rhythm of the game is 10 times faster than it should be. I spent a week playing BF1 to warmup for this. In BF1 you can easily stay alive 5min+ while still being active. BF6 is CoD rhythm, no time to hide or hold a power position, just die and retry, respawn is instantaneous.

It doesn't feel like I'm preparing to engage a battlefield, have retreat points, have to plan an attack, be active while careful at the same time. I'm not entering a war, with a meaningful ""one life to make an impact"" feeling. If I get shot at, I don't have time to slow down, wait, understand the situation and figure out a plan to get them. Just CoD spawn, run and gun, get some kills randomly, die and retry.

Assault has 3 weapons by default including an OP 1 shot shotgun as a ""gadget"".

The 6+ customisation slots per weapon are silly. You're over complicating the customisation, which will make every patch have to balance them, and it will obviously never be balanced well because there are too many variables. Add to this the open-class modes, and you just multiplied the complexity of balancing by 4. This is just to add more micro progression for players to pay attention to, for player retention. It doesn't actually make the game better.

Game looks bad, idk how BF1 an almost 10 year old game somehow looks better than BF6.

UI is garbage, hitmarkers are bad, the dmg/kill feed doesn't feel impactful and isn't instantly redeable so you know exactly what you're doing. I have to look away from my center screen to know how many people I've killed, I can't tell just from the act of having killed them, or from a well placed UI. In BF1 I can instantly and easily tell how much dmg/kills I've done, without it interrupting my attention and gameplay. 

The UI has an overwhelming amount of information, and the important information gets lost, and is hard to find and read fast enough to be ""viable"" in moment to moment gunplay.

When you die the killfeed overlaps with the res UI, because everything is positioned wrong and too big and cramped.

The spawn map UI is over-designed to ""look cool"" which is stupid. The in game map is under designed, lost all the amazing customisation from BF1.

The menus UI are over complicated and unintuitive.

Over half the controller settings from BF1 are gone. There aren't even deadzone settings. This is literally a joke.

I thought this was the real comeback from BC2/BF3 era, with a modern setting, no non-sense style gameplay, but no. They obviously CoD-ified everything and I guess we're never getting that meaningful gameplay back. I played BC2 last probably 15 years ago, and I still remember the very unique feeling and impact every gun had. If I had it in my hands now I would probably still have the recoil patterns, the flanks and tactics in Rush.

Gunplay and movement feel great, maps are also good but we should definitely get 2/3 large scale maps in the full game. Vehicles are significantly improved from 2042 but still need a lot of work; no directional damage and disabling mechanic is a huge letdown. Don’t understand the CoD comparisons.

Maps are a bit small but hopefully we get something bigger come release, on the same scale as Firestorm hopefully. Than being said, they resemble a lot the small/medium maps from BF3 in terms of time to engagement and chaos factor, so I like them a lot. Breakthrough needs some more balancing as I still haven’t finished a single match ending in attacker victory, I think this is mostly due to the defenders spawn being too close to the objectives. Conquest seems ok except for a lot of flag inverting going on especially on Gibraltar; don’t know if it’s the player base or if there’s something going on with the map flow; the mode is a lot of fun regardless, just don’t expect to fight inch by inch on a single front.

Gunplay is great, loving the customisation options, handling, sound and TTK. It also seems like the movement penalties while shooting are pretty big, especially when jumping and strafing. There is fortunately some spread and killing at long distance requires burst control, I was worried we would get Warzone level laser beams but that’s not the case.

Movement is also on point, in line with BF3 and BF4 in terms of traversal speed. Slides, crouch running and diving seem pretty balanced and haven’t seen any abuse. At no point I’ve felt like in a cod lobby or forced to move like I’m on adderall to win 1v1s, also with the low TTK the people jumping just look like dumbasses when they inevitably get shot at by 2/3 people in a choke point.

Vehicles feel a bit underpowered and that’s unfortunate. I like the balancing of the primary guns to match the vehicle role, for example splash damage on tanks is almost non existent but the secondary gun is very powerful, so you’re not incentivised to just camp. Same goes for IFVs, AA, helis and jets. On the other hand, while an improvement over 2042, there’s basically no depth to the combat. Any shot deals the same damage regardless of shot placement, for tanks this is equal to 25hp, and an engineer has 5 rockets by default so they can fuck them up on their own from afar without any strategy. I would much rather have directional damage back and lower rockets from the engineer, so that it either takes skill or at least two infantry to kill a tank. At the same time the repair tool is incredibly overpowered, and combined with the dumb auto repair feature it is literally impossible to kill a tank manned by a full squad, which also feels stupid. Helis and jets seem a lot harder to use in terms of movement, but I feel like that’s a good thing. I like that the attack heli pilot is basically useless against infantry, that seat should be meant to be anti-tank and AA defense, not for farming kills. That being said, a larger map and full gadget availability are needed to form a clearer opinion.

Sound, graphics and smoothness are just great. The destruction is really fun and what I missed the most from BF3. Finally we’re back to being able to carve our own path and shape the map to gain a tactical advantage, something that was sacrificed as early as BF4 in favour of levolution.

I do not agree with the ground war comparisons, this is 100% a game that feels and plays like battlefield, even if we have been given maps on the smaller side. The shitty attempt at creating a BF clone by just letting you spam slide cancels and bunny hopping in a larger map that is ground war is not even close to this. That is if you’re not just sitting somewhere afar from the objectives with a sniper rifle, then maybe I could see the point.",41,1754582837.0,t3_1mk0tn7,False

* Sounds are a bit overwhelming but I guess they can tune it down a bit
* HUD is BUSY by default. Peripheral vision icons are way too big and have 100% opacity. The squad members list text is huge. Default icon size for friendlies is too big IMO. I spent a solid 15 minutes tuning it. Having gray text for kill and score updates doesn't feel great. In other games, the text is red or orange for kills, and it looks better.
* It's much (!) better than 2042, but for some reason it doesn't feel like Battlefield as much as BF3, BF4, or BF1. I think the music makes it too generic, like it's trying to sound like the Warzone menu music a bit.
* The gun range is stupid lol they only let you Test one gun at a time instead of the full loadout... Why?!  You can also literally run out of ammo in the gun range lmao
* Maps are waaay too narrow and there is little chance for flanking. The elevation differences enable and promote camping, and flanking routes are always covered by snipers or engineers with RPGs.
* If an attack helicopter is taken by a teammate, you cannot spawn on it unless you're in the squad. Why?!?! It doesn't happen with tanks, so I'm guessing it's a bug.
* Sniping feels inconsistent as hell, not sure if the drop is too fast, the visual recoil makes it so that the cross hair is not really on the target, or if it's something with the muzzle velocity. It could also be a skill issue, but it still doesn't feel as satisfying as BF4 sniping.
* Having 3 RPG rockets is way too much and also being able to have both RPG and an AA rocket launcher is crazy lol
* Visually, a bit more saturation could feel better in the Liberation Peak map.
* The vehicle health indicator is very small and not easy to read when you have all the other visual noise from fire and explosions IMO 
* Settings are difficult to navigate and reset to a different category if you hit escape. The explanation for settings is hilariously bad, e.g. ""SOVIS filter"" -&gt; ""Enables SOVIS enemy filter""... The FUCK does that mean?? 
* There is no demonstration of the visual or graphics settings, so you do a lot of guess work. In general, you have to do lots of clicking to go into the settings you want, and to change them to what you like. 
* Lots of hidden settings options, like why do the graphics menu have compartmentalized Advanced Graphics, the Display settings are two sections below the top section, the Icons and Indicators section mentions HUD icons, but there's a whole-ass HUD section below? SO confusing. Scrolling down these menus is also unreasonably slow, like it's only a few lines per scroll.

Fly zone is really small on Liberation peak, I hope this doesn't come back as an issue on other maps.

Why is the heli missiles on semi ? let it rip ! and they're heavy as hell

M4 carbine over performs against smg, maybe against full ARs as well

Scope magnification feels very inconsistent, also why do we have a 6x with scope glint and a 5x without ? there's no reason to pick one over the other.

I thought everyone being able to revive was going to be cool, but I now realize that me not killing the nth guy in a row means that everything I have done can be undone immediately. Does promote teamplay tho (until I see the last guy make a fool of my teammate as he guns down 3 others)

Why are snipers sometimes OS in the thorax (at a distance) ? I'm not aware of how that mechanic works and honestly pretty trashy one, at least close range upper chest kills back in BF3/4 were high risk and fun

ammo capacity with ARs is really low, but weirdly not the case of carbines ?

the varying thickness of the holo sight is interesting but not as good as varying illumination

- Main menu UI is *horrendous*. I saw someone compare it to ""Hulu"" and thats a great (damning) comparison. Saw a reworked [menu someone made a concept for](https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1956086643624202344) and it's infinitely superior.  

- Hiding/removing Closed Weapons really feels like a way to manipulate statistics to claim it's ""less popular"". I feel Open Weapons just reduces class identity and decreases teamwork. I'd prefer DICE give Closed Weapons more focus.  

- I don't particularly like Health/Ammo being combined into one box.   

- Health/Ammo box seems a bit too spammable, defib cooldown seems way too low and revives players at FAR too much health for a tap click.  

- LMGs seem extremely weak, with hipfire being basically unusable. Seemed like every time I tried to hipfire mine, I'd shoot a Loony Tunes silhouette around the guy I was aiming for -- only to get bursted down by an M4 in about a half second.  

- Suppression doesn't seem effective for anything but making you feel better with a couple of points. Suppressing snipers just led to them killing me anyway.  

- Maps felt far too small, with not nearly enough verticality to justify the size. If we're going to have small, urban meat grinder maps -- I'd prefer Pearl Market to Cairo.

- Liberation Peak feels imbalanced, and needs the central mountain addressed, and the push to F feels impossible. Some extra routes would be very welcome. Also the sheer number of scope glints will haunt my nightmares.  

- The HUD UI/UX is awful, cluttered and visually confusing.

The experience is overall still great, game slaps, definitely worth buying. I may be wrong on this list, so feel free to disagree.

1. Accessories make ARs too strong. Already in the beta, there are lots of assaults with full kit outcompeting every other weapon at every distance except extremely long range. I suggest nerfing the recoil reduction accessories significantly.
2. Helicopters feel very bad to drive. It seems everyone agrees with this one.
3. The open weapons system needs to be tweaked. Already in the beta, assault outcompets the scout class, since you can have a sniper rifle and a carbine as secondary. Basically, it seems like you always choose assault unless you want to destroy tanks or heal/support your team.
4. The closed weapons system is better, but still quite bad, since the LMG feels really bad with the combat medic class. In modern military and in every Battlefield, the machine gunner, or ""support,"" is very different from the combat medic. The game was clearly designed with open weapons in mind, giving you the possibility to create your own combat medic or machine gunner. I would suggest having an open weapons system, except you lock sniper rifles and LMGs to their respective class, since those are the classes that are most defined by their weapons. All the other weapons are open to everyone.
5. This subreddit doesn't like the smaller maps of the beta. Personally, I enjoy them quite a lot, but it's clear that the beta lacks the full battlefield experience.",19,1754581975.0,t3_1mk0tn7,False

Text chat is segregated into groups [team/squad/all] and when you select either one of them, the other messages in those chat groups are NOT included in the others, so it’s not like the other titles where you were always looking at all chat, but selected wherever you wanted to type instead of changing the chat section completely

Reticle glow, opacity, color settings are missing (2013 BF4 feature, come on) 

Can’t use a canted sight without a main sight (yes, this is needed)

Can’t adjust zoom per scope magnification level (if I’m not missing something)

Scoreboard is not always showing 32 players? Like really? BF6 scoreboard doesn’t show any more information than BF4 scoreboard did, why are we forced to press buttons and scroll to see the entire team structure?

Can’t see ranks in the scoreboard

No ribbons, medals

Unlocked attachments and new unlocks are right INSIDE the text chat which blocks the view of one another (consequence of putting the big ass score at the top instead of bottom left near radar like 3/4, but that can be dealt with through optional settings). Also no cool colors and fluff like 3/4 for the unlocked things except the ranks, I guess it’s just a stylistic choice

Minimap size doesn’t go above 100% (2013 BF4 feature, again)

Names above players can’t be hidden on per group basis nor can they be hidden at all I’m pretty sure (squad/team/enemy can be separately hidden in BF4 2013 feature again, but regarding squad/team that may have been the same group in BF4 for that specific feature)

Bad bottom right UI choices resulting in impossible or very hard to easily understand if your gadget is loaded or has ammo, due to it having an entirely separate ammo counter (in a separate box) that doesn’t even show if it’s loaded or not. To give a bigger example: Shoot an rpg, swap to your main weapon, swap back at some point later. In BF4 the ammo counter would show your gadgets ammo (RPG in this case) in BF6 it doesn’t have a general ammo counter resulting in confusion

Hit sound and kill sound are treated as the same thing with the hit sound setting, which if turned off turns off both the kill &amp; hit sound, very annoying and needs to be separated

Color hex codes can’t be typed in in the colors section

No cool ranks like in BF3/4, they seemingly look generally the same, maybe I’m wrong

Some of the reticle sizes in the scopes seem to be either too big or too small, can’t scroll up to add to the reticle comment, but yeah

No faction insignia, logo or name near the tickets score of each team (like RU vs CHINA in BF4 &amp; German flag vs British flag in BF1)

First person sensitivity is completely broken for me in some vehicles like in jets or tanks and the settings don’t seem to change much, they are just extremely slow

Zoom in tanks doesn’t seem to be instant? Was that always the case? I remember being able to spam right click zoom in BF3/4 with no problem, in BF6 there is a big delay between each zoom-in

The &lt;in combat&gt; state of your squad-mate seems to be taking too long to reset at the moment

So far these are the things I noticed, please add more in the comments! Maybe devs will notice this thread

What most players have issue with is the rapid change in direction and momentum changing stances and vaulting, like jump sliding into a slide cancel. Spamming inputs should have an escalating momentum penalty. You can dive onto the ground fast, slide into cover fast, etc, but standing up afterwards or vaulting over a ledge should be slower.

Gadgets: The only complaint is the double launchers. I heard that was being addressed, and this is an old build, so that's good. I disagree with other comments and posts saying two gadgets is too much, or that having two explosive gadgets is too much. I could not disagree more with this. We've been able to have some combination of rockets, mines, dynamite, and anti-tank grenades for as long as I can remember. Two launchers is too much, but one launcher and a throwable explosive isn't. The reason why vehicles may seem underpowered isn't because infantry has so many options, because that's always been the case.

Vehicles: I'm not a vehicle player, but I love hunting tanks. From an outside perspective, I can tell what they mean when they bring up their controls. They appear slow, sluggish, and a bit too weak. Engineer mains appreciate the challenge, make us earn those kills. 

Other notes: 

I don't play a lot of assault but I don't hate the sling, I think it's a neat idea. Maybe make it so the second primary can only be equipped with an optic. For the shotgun, maybe limit it to the smaller and lighter tube. Just throwing support for the sling out there, it's caught some heat from the community. 

Let's crank up the knockback and rag doll physics from the shotgun in OHK range, I've been obsessed with the clip of the guy getting launched out of the window lol

Edit: how could I forget, server browser and persistent servers. I know we're making some gains, but it should be the norm. I've been playing on the same BF1 server for like 4 years. Modern games have been terrible at letting the player base form communities, and players are begging for you to let us. Give us the tools to do so and you'll have a stronger, more loyal, and more consistent player base. I know there's internal pressure from high up to try and keep players engaged and they believe that matchmaking is the solution, but I can promise you most of us don't need an algorithm to try and curate a ""fair"" experience for us.

Edit 2: Seeing some comments about shotguns being OP. In my experience, shotguns take 3-4 shots to kill at midrange. I gotta see more attachments, but right now I can't really engage with bad guys across the street lol. Which is fine. I think it's a combination of the maps being a bit small and cramped, and people probably not realizing they're not at full health. All my midrange kills usually take 4 good shots, or I'm finishing a weak enemy. Full disclosure I'm a shotgun main, can't wait to get slugs and the ACOG lol.",10,1754584798.0,t3_1mk0tn7,False

Right now,  in the Battlefield 6 open(closed) beta, it seems that non-leader players cannot properly request orders from their squad leader. This removes a key layer of communication and coordination, especially important in random squads where players don’t use voice chat.

In past Battlefield titles, players could ping an objective to request a squad order, and if the leader didn’t respond after a few requests, leadership would transfer. That mechanic appears to be missing or broken in the beta. Played now for 2 hours on PS5 in the closed beta.

Please reintroduce:  
 • The ability to request squad orders via pings  
 • Squad leader prompts to accept/reject the request  
 • Auto-promotion to squad leader if no orders are given over time

These small systems go a long way in encouraging teamwork, and Battlefield is at its best when players are working toward shared goals.

In conquest you have a few seconds before you get to see the first enemies, in the other modes you often spawn with enemies right in your face and get fired at.

You play supersoldiers on steroids, dashing and sliding around the map at high speeds, taking six to seven bullets without dying. Sprinting and firing precisely right afterwards. The heavy MG on that huge tank? Needs three bullets to take you down.

Holding a position isn't viable because the group of hyperactive monkeys with shotguns are right on you seconds after spawning. In the same way you can just flood the enemy positions with shit like that.

SMG's have way too much range and way too much damage, like some how the MP7 can make pinpoint shots at like 150m that a mounted LMG struggles with.

* There is no journey around the map. Like the maps used to have size and scale to them. But like if I wanna go behind enemy lines and get to the completely opposite cap on Liberation peak I am funneled down in to everyone. Either the snipers who do nothing but sit there all game or I'm on an open hillside with no cover and eventually a random guy kills me. Used to if I wanted to be useless for 6 minutes and go the path less traveled I could do that and make it to cap closest to the enemy HQ. That seems impossible now with these map layouts.

* There is not a single POI worth fighting for on any of these maps. Completely forgettable. 2 meat grinder maps where every engagement is the same and one sniper fest while the air warfare people fuck off all game. 

* ""Enemy Tank spotted directly North of your position"" Great info, good callout, which way is North? I should not have to open my full size map for cardinal directions. Put it on the minimap or put it on the screen so I can give a call out in numbers. ""Sniper North of us 14 degrees"" 

* Can we change or prepare loadouts inbetween games? That would be nice like if you stay in the lobby and get stuck on finding another match for a minute or two.

* Movement is like smooth but still has that Battlefield clunky-ness to it that all BF games have had which  is not really a problem. But you just move too fast. Like watch Shroud play. He is FLYING all over the map on foot. It looks like someone took CoD/Apex movement and dropped it in to a Battlefield game. I don't like how that plays.

Nothing I experienced so far is game-breaking, **except for the 1-shot sniper shotgun on the OP assault class**. Other things I noticed, but can deal with:

* Sliding still seems excessive, not like CoD, but maybe bordering it at times. 
* Only 1 map feels big enough to invoke a grandiose Battlefield experience. The rest were just mazes of buildings and streets.
   * Since the other maps are smaller, everything kinetic feels much faster and gives it a CoD feel. 
* Grenade animation and throw is very cartoony, definitely in-line with a CoD throw. 
* Assault is now a 1-man army class with a main weapon, a pistol, the 1-shot sniper shotgun, a grenade launcher (or 2 if you unequip the shotgun), a standalone grenade, and a self-heal.
   * Once it gets the deployment beacon, and people equip a sniper rifle as the main weapon, the assault class will become the one class to rule them all. 

If Battlefield 6 is being designed to feel like the 2023 CoD Ground War mode, then mission accomplished. From a business standpoint that might make the most sense so that EA / Dice can lure in the CoD players, while keeping the Battlefield players somewhat happy. Hopefully it'll feel more grandiose in October, but it's current state is enjoyable and leagues better than BF 2042.

Disabling/Enabling Motion Blur

Disabling/Enabling FPS Limiters

Unfortunately while Battlefield 6 runs well, it just looks off. It's almost as if it appears to be 1/2 the framerate. It just seems very jittery looking and I'm not quite sure what is the culprit, but something is very clearly broken.

UI: is pretty poor in the menus. Not intuitive and at times just not telling me what my options are - same as 2042.

Experienced very few bugs, still playing around with settings but no issues with performance either. A couple TTD issues (I can’t remember which title it was in but sometimes it feels like you get one tapped but actually the damage shows the guy sprayed you and hit you five times with the damage all being delivered at once).

Edit: I take it back, recharging only shows when you are near a support crate. Very nice.",7,1754604201.0,t3_1mk0tn7,False

If I get the jump on someone or flank, they die really quick and there's no issue. If they just slightly beat me to it, it seems like my bullets do half or quarter damage. 

Probably a skill issue, but I've played probably 2-3000 hours across BF3, 4, V, 1 and 2042 with the most in BF3 and 1. I have enjoyed all those titles greatly (except 2042 at launch) and I've only put a few hours into beta but it just feels crappy. The visibility seems absolutely atrocious.

I think the BETA so far has been very good - lots to really like, but a few things are sapping some of that fun away. 

TTK.  I'm not sure if its me, but the TTK seems very, very fast.  It's almost who sees who first, a flip of the coin luck.  You have no time to react to situations, no time to run for cover, no time to pull off those awesome clutch moments.  This affects vehicles too. Their health pool seems so low, that they can be easily taken out with a single person, in a flash.    
Finally, the weapons feel strangely balanced.  An LMG does no damage at mid to long range, and can easily be outmatched by an assault rifle, which can hit you down in 2-4 shots.  this makes it almost redundant against other weapons.

Graphically noisey, audibly directionally unclear, ingame UI frustratingly deviating from basic UIX principles - as others have said it's very iPaddy. I get that it's supposed to be a modern warfare setting - but does EVERYTHING need to be blanketed in this static/interference aesthetic? And if it does, the brain is pretty good at identifying silhouettes but they just aren't there yet. Everything blends together in the same colour palette, and the available maps are void of any strategic battlefielding. I'm not a netcode expert, but it sometimes feels like I've selected rubber bullets on the loadout.

-Agreed on returning to traditional class icons, bring back the spanner


-Larger squad sizes


-Audio rework


-Battlefield maps


-Return to live 'satellite' view of the spawn map (there were satellites in WW1!), replacing the cel shaded mess


-UIX rework. I don't need to see 3D renders of what me and my squad may/or may not look like everywhere in the UI

Because I think people would love to see more than just a little two story shack crumble to the ground, they would like to see cranes fall over (like on BF4 operation Firestorm), antenna towers falling over, blocking a road, etc etc 

There is a lot of destruction that happened in BF4, and that even ran on the PS3 and Xbox 360. I think people were hoping for some sort of upgrade to destruction since this is the first battlefield game to be on current gen consoles only.

Like don't get me wrong, rubble drops are cool and blowing out floors, but we've had rubble drops since BF3 and that isn't anything new, and the destruction at least from the maps that we've played on, doesn't change the flow of the map at all. 

Look at C flag on Iberian Offensive, there are so many dark areas that enemies can hide in, because there are so many indestructible walls, and you can't even destroy or collapse part of the building (something similar to Hainan Resort).

I will say part of the problem with netcode on BF3 and any older game is that as playerbases start to dwindle, you start to get more and more high ping players.

BF3 would feel a lot better (although still not as good as a modern title) if the whole server was on 30-60ms. Conversely, BF6 would feel a lot worse if half the players on a US west server were from Brazil and Argentina.

The game pacing of BF6, IMO, is the largest difference between BF6 and the older BF titles. And no, its not because of the movement.

As you mentioned, health regeneration is a big one. In BF6, there is a 5 second health regen delay followed by health regeneration that heals you up to full health within 5 seconds. That's a 10 second return time to full health, vs. the 36 seconds (16 second delay followed by health regeneration that takes 20 seconds to heal you up to full health) in BF3.

A strong suppression mechanic also slows the pacing of the game down. Inhibiting a player's ability to secure kills draws out engagements and results in more tactical gameplay. I know it is controversial, but a strong suppression mechanic in BF6 would work wonders at bringing it more in line with BF3/BF4 gameplay.

The target acquisition is another large offender on this front. In BF6, the game places red dots above enemy heads that are remotely near the center of your screen and also within \~35m of you, before they are even spotted. This allows you to follow up with a quick and easy manual spot, at which their locations would be communicated to the rest of your team in a similar manner. When more players are spotted, more engagements happen a lot quicker.

The pacing issues of BF6 are well described in this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mlf1n8/i\_got\_to\_max\_level\_and\_completed\_all\_challenges/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web3x&amp;utm\_name=web3xcss&amp;utm\_term=1&amp;utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mlf1n8/i_got_to_max_level_and_completed_all_challenges/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",6,1755623853.0,t3_1muirze,False

The pace is definitely slower for all the reasons you listed, and while it has some advantages, the game also tends to be a bit more campy and random than I'd like. Getting shot at while out of cover is a death sentence, and with the short TTK you frequently die in an instant from an unknown direction.


With newer BF titles you have a bit more control on your movement and your deaths are a bit more predictable.

The most frustrating thing for me was how the immediate second you are hit with a defib in 6, you could laser the person/squad that had gunned you down. Every time I wondered why the trade off isn’t 1) defib revive makes it so you cannot react immediately 2) dragging revive allows you to immediately react as it takes time and gives the enemy a chance to kill the medic/squadmate.

The overall movement in BF3 being slow made every action feel more meaningful. A staple memory for me was spending 5 minutes running across map thinking I’m being tactical, just to be killed immediately…. And then do it all over again.

I still play regularly 3 and 4 after the beta, and gunplay is way way better on 3, and better on 4 . 

The movement is good in beta but I think a lot of people will definitely start overusing slides and jump and will become a bunnyhop shitfest pretty soon, and I'd hate that.

Sniper is way too easy in BF6, peak sniping was achieved in bf4 where it was the perfect balance between skill and easy to to.

I don't think vehicles are that bad in bf6, with just a little bit of tweaking they can be good.

But I agree that the assault doesn't make any sense currently, it was way better when it had the medic role.

Normal animations, penalties for dying a getting rezed, not stupid CoD movement so you can just slide everywhere and you actually have to think about your positioning.

This is why games were just better back then.

I’ll never understand why so many of you are adamant about every game becoming this same shitty, cheap arcade style feel to it.

BF6 and most of the industry is simply creating games for streamers and wanna be streamers to clip farm. And no I’m not even being hyperbolic when I say that. It’s become so obvious.

I can’t wait for the day a dev team mans up and actually gives us a grounder shooter again that’s not a MilSim and still has fun arcadey gameplay like the older BF games. (Looking at you embark)",1,1755625996.0,t3_1muirze,False

I know you’re probably going to get a bunch of “hate” because everyone likes to pretend some fixed moment in the past was the best. I see people still saying “BF3 graphics were better”. It’s like come on.

You gave your opinion and I didn’t have to agree with all of it to feel it was fair and you were being objective and not just a fanboy even though you really love the series. I agree with most of it, appreciate it, and can’t wait for BF6. 

So weird watching all of these like purist folks like “the maps and game peaked in BF3”. Well how about you all hop on your PS3s and Xbox360s and have fun. Since that’s the best way to play.",0,1755622374.0,t3_1muirze,False

People kinda make themselves look a bit foolish claiming otherwise. But all games evolve. You just have to decide whether you like what the game is evolving into or not. Anyone saying ""you're remembering it wrong, because I said so"" is frankly just a dumbass who can't accept that someone else may not like the game. Which is obviously weird.

It would be hard going back to that slower movement, even if it is probably more realistic (jump shots lmao), but what makes it more glaring in BF6's beta is that it's combined with the smaller maps. I mean, imagine if someone is sliding around at like 75m, they wouldn't really scare anyone.
