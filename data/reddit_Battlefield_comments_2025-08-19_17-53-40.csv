It may be that the maps we have in beta are just not a good showing for the ground vehicles, but they are far to tight for the vehicles we have, the amount of RPG's sent at you in such a tight space you have nowhere to go and you are just fucked even with people repairing.

Attack Helicopters. Holy shit what have you done DICE? Looking at comments in other places people dont seem to like 2042 Heli controls, Me personally I had no issues with them, they felt like I could manouver them well and do some cool tricks and aim accuratley. The attack helicopter in 6 feels like im flying an absolute brick, with sensitivity punched way up it only helps slightly, Yaw is nigh on non existant and the accerleration/speed is so ridiculous that your pitch so screwed that you either cant pull up at all or if you are trying to do an attack run you end up going nose first into the ground at the slightest tilt down of the nose. These controls are awful, the worst helicopter controls I've ever seen in a battlefield game. Whats with the rockets as well and aiming them? are you meant be eaiming for inbetween the two lines? the dot in the middle of the lines? because the rockets you fire dont track accuratley to either of them at all and seem to curve? are they smart rockets? they cant be that smart because they cant hit shit.

On both ground vehicles and Helicopters WASD also just dont seem to work well? Using the Abrahms or IFV there has been a fair few occasions where W or S + A or D just dosnt seem to work and they also seem to do nothing in the helicopter beyond making it fly at Mach 10 with W.

Gunplay is ok. But it doesn't feel exceptional. TTK is weird. I need to empty mags to kill but it feels like I get absolutely destroyed a lot of times, ie. I die extremely quickly.

Air vehicles feels bad to maneuver. Very floaty.

Tanks feel heavy, but not really that powerful. And there are too few of them. The number kind of fits the current map size, but I would rather see maps being a bit bigger to fit more vehicles. 

Then there's the UI. There's just too much going on. The outlines of friendlies through walls just annoy me. And I want a list of my squad in the deployment screen to see all their classes quickly so I myself can select an appropriate class.

Graphics are nice, but feels a little bit grainy. Could be my settings. Running everything on ultra with a 4090 and performance is great. I have some graphical glitches but it's not too bad.

Overall a massive step up from 2042, and it's only early beta. Haven't decided wether I will buy it on release day. We'll see.

Update: After playing some more I feel like the maps really just lack character. The city maps are just a maze of alleyways and hallways. And the capture points are so forgettable.

Gunplay is too fast and without impact. When I shoot I can barely tell if I'm hitting, and when getting shot it's the same. Shooting is too floaty. Grenade throw is instantaneous. TTK is too fast. Too many movement options, I got corner killed by a jump shooter. This is literally a CoD movement tech, why is it here? The gunplay+movement combination make it feel too arcadey.

Sound design is generic and doesn't make the weapons feel powerful, how did we go from BF1 sound design to this audio soup? In BF1 footsteps are very clear, well positioned, well detailed. In BF6 I get rushed all the time and never hear anything. 

The overall rhythm of the game is 10 times faster than it should be. I spent a week playing BF1 to warmup for this. In BF1 you can easily stay alive 5min+ while still being active. BF6 is CoD rhythm, no time to hide or hold a power position, just die and retry, respawn is instantaneous.

It doesn't feel like I'm preparing to engage a battlefield, have retreat points, have to plan an attack, be active while careful at the same time. I'm not entering a war, with a meaningful ""one life to make an impact"" feeling. If I get shot at, I don't have time to slow down, wait, understand the situation and figure out a plan to get them. Just CoD spawn, run and gun, get some kills randomly, die and retry.

Assault has 3 weapons by default including an OP 1 shot shotgun as a ""gadget"".

The 6+ customisation slots per weapon are silly. You're over complicating the customisation, which will make every patch have to balance them, and it will obviously never be balanced well because there are too many variables. Add to this the open-class modes, and you just multiplied the complexity of balancing by 4. This is just to add more micro progression for players to pay attention to, for player retention. It doesn't actually make the game better.

Game looks bad, idk how BF1 an almost 10 year old game somehow looks better than BF6.

UI is garbage, hitmarkers are bad, the dmg/kill feed doesn't feel impactful and isn't instantly redeable so you know exactly what you're doing. I have to look away from my center screen to know how many people I've killed, I can't tell just from the act of having killed them, or from a well placed UI. In BF1 I can instantly and easily tell how much dmg/kills I've done, without it interrupting my attention and gameplay. 

The UI has an overwhelming amount of information, and the important information gets lost, and is hard to find and read fast enough to be ""viable"" in moment to moment gunplay.

When you die the killfeed overlaps with the res UI, because everything is positioned wrong and too big and cramped.

The spawn map UI is over-designed to ""look cool"" which is stupid. The in game map is under designed, lost all the amazing customisation from BF1.

The menus UI are over complicated and unintuitive.

Over half the controller settings from BF1 are gone. There aren't even deadzone settings. This is literally a joke.

I thought this was the real comeback from BC2/BF3 era, with a modern setting, no non-sense style gameplay, but no. They obviously CoD-ified everything and I guess we're never getting that meaningful gameplay back. I played BC2 last probably 15 years ago, and I still remember the very unique feeling and impact every gun had. If I had it in my hands now I would probably still have the recoil patterns, the flanks and tactics in Rush.

Good for them for their 100 million future copies sold, good for people who like this CoD/BF hybrid. Bye Battelfield, you were great.",14,1754648713.0,t3_1mk0tn7,False

Gunplay and movement feel great, maps are also good but we should definitely get 2/3 large scale maps in the full game. Vehicles are significantly improved from 2042 but still need a lot of work; no directional damage and disabling mechanic is a huge letdown. Don’t understand the CoD comparisons.

Maps are a bit small but hopefully we get something bigger come release, on the same scale as Firestorm hopefully. Than being said, they resemble a lot the small/medium maps from BF3 in terms of time to engagement and chaos factor, so I like them a lot. Breakthrough needs some more balancing as I still haven’t finished a single match ending in attacker victory, I think this is mostly due to the defenders spawn being too close to the objectives. Conquest seems ok except for a lot of flag inverting going on especially on Gibraltar; don’t know if it’s the player base or if there’s something going on with the map flow; the mode is a lot of fun regardless, just don’t expect to fight inch by inch on a single front.

Gunplay is great, loving the customisation options, handling, sound and TTK. It also seems like the movement penalties while shooting are pretty big, especially when jumping and strafing. There is fortunately some spread and killing at long distance requires burst control, I was worried we would get Warzone level laser beams but that’s not the case.

Movement is also on point, in line with BF3 and BF4 in terms of traversal speed. Slides, crouch running and diving seem pretty balanced and haven’t seen any abuse. At no point I’ve felt like in a cod lobby or forced to move like I’m on adderall to win 1v1s, also with the low TTK the people jumping just look like dumbasses when they inevitably get shot at by 2/3 people in a choke point.

Vehicles feel a bit underpowered and that’s unfortunate. I like the balancing of the primary guns to match the vehicle role, for example splash damage on tanks is almost non existent but the secondary gun is very powerful, so you’re not incentivised to just camp. Same goes for IFVs, AA, helis and jets. On the other hand, while an improvement over 2042, there’s basically no depth to the combat. Any shot deals the same damage regardless of shot placement, for tanks this is equal to 25hp, and an engineer has 5 rockets by default so they can fuck them up on their own from afar without any strategy. I would much rather have directional damage back and lower rockets from the engineer, so that it either takes skill or at least two infantry to kill a tank. At the same time the repair tool is incredibly overpowered, and combined with the dumb auto repair feature it is literally impossible to kill a tank manned by a full squad, which also feels stupid. Helis and jets seem a lot harder to use in terms of movement, but I feel like that’s a good thing. I like that the attack heli pilot is basically useless against infantry, that seat should be meant to be anti-tank and AA defense, not for farming kills. That being said, a larger map and full gadget availability are needed to form a clearer opinion.

Sound, graphics and smoothness are just great. The destruction is really fun and what I missed the most from BF3. Finally we’re back to being able to carve our own path and shape the map to gain a tactical advantage, something that was sacrificed as early as BF4 in favour of levolution.

I do not agree with the ground war comparisons, this is 100% a game that feels and plays like battlefield, even if we have been given maps on the smaller side. The shitty attempt at creating a BF clone by just letting you spam slide cancels and bunny hopping in a larger map that is ground war is not even close to this. That is if you’re not just sitting somewhere afar from the objectives with a sniper rifle, then maybe I could see the point.",39,1754582837.0,t3_1mk0tn7,False

* Sounds are a bit overwhelming but I guess they can tune it down a bit
* HUD is BUSY by default. Peripheral vision icons are way too big and have 100% opacity. The squad members list text is huge. Default icon size for friendlies is too big IMO. I spent a solid 15 minutes tuning it. Having gray text for kill and score updates doesn't feel great. In other games, the text is red or orange for kills, and it looks better.
* It's much (!) better than 2042, but for some reason it doesn't feel like Battlefield as much as BF3, BF4, or BF1. I think the music makes it too generic, like it's trying to sound like the Warzone menu music a bit.
* The gun range is stupid lol they only let you Test one gun at a time instead of the full loadout... Why?!  You can also literally run out of ammo in the gun range lmao
* Maps are waaay too narrow and there is little chance for flanking. The elevation differences enable and promote camping, and flanking routes are always covered by snipers or engineers with RPGs.
* If an attack helicopter is taken by a teammate, you cannot spawn on it unless you're in the squad. Why?!?! It doesn't happen with tanks, so I'm guessing it's a bug.
* Sniping feels inconsistent as hell, not sure if the drop is too fast, the visual recoil makes it so that the cross hair is not really on the target, or if it's something with the muzzle velocity. It could also be a skill issue, but it still doesn't feel as satisfying as BF4 sniping.
* Having 3 RPG rockets is way too much and also being able to have both RPG and an AA rocket launcher is crazy lol
* Visually, a bit more saturation could feel better in the Liberation Peak map.
* The vehicle health indicator is very small and not easy to read when you have all the other visual noise from fire and explosions IMO 
* Settings are difficult to navigate and reset to a different category if you hit escape. The explanation for settings is hilariously bad, e.g. ""SOVIS filter"" -&gt; ""Enables SOVIS enemy filter""... The FUCK does that mean?? 
* There is no demonstration of the visual or graphics settings, so you do a lot of guess work. In general, you have to do lots of clicking to go into the settings you want, and to change them to what you like. 
* Lots of hidden settings options, like why do the graphics menu have compartmentalized Advanced Graphics, the Display settings are two sections below the top section, the Icons and Indicators section mentions HUD icons, but there's a whole-ass HUD section below? SO confusing. Scrolling down these menus is also unreasonably slow, like it's only a few lines per scroll.

Assault with double primaries is too much. I’m finding the protocol is run around with AR and switch to shotgun the second you enter a building.

Fly zone is really small on Liberation peak, I hope this doesn't come back as an issue on other maps.

Why is the heli missiles on semi ? let it rip ! and they're heavy as hell

M4 carbine over performs against smg, maybe against full ARs as well

Scope magnification feels very inconsistent, also why do we have a 6x with scope glint and a 5x without ? there's no reason to pick one over the other.

I thought everyone being able to revive was going to be cool, but I now realize that me not killing the nth guy in a row means that everything I have done can be undone immediately. Does promote teamplay tho (until I see the last guy make a fool of my teammate as he guns down 3 others)

Why are snipers sometimes OS in the thorax (at a distance) ? I'm not aware of how that mechanic works and honestly pretty trashy one, at least close range upper chest kills back in BF3/4 were high risk and fun

ammo capacity with ARs is really low, but weirdly not the case of carbines ?

the varying thickness of the holo sight is interesting but not as good as varying illumination

- Main menu UI is *horrendous*. I saw someone compare it to ""Hulu"" and thats a great (damning) comparison. Saw a reworked [menu someone made a concept for](https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1956086643624202344) and it's infinitely superior.  

- Hiding/removing Closed Weapons really feels like a way to manipulate statistics to claim it's ""less popular"". I feel Open Weapons just reduces class identity and decreases teamwork. I'd prefer DICE give Closed Weapons more focus.  

- I don't particularly like Health/Ammo being combined into one box.   

- Health/Ammo box seems a bit too spammable, defib cooldown seems way too low and revives players at FAR too much health for a tap click.  

- LMGs seem extremely weak, with hipfire being basically unusable. Seemed like every time I tried to hipfire mine, I'd shoot a Loony Tunes silhouette around the guy I was aiming for -- only to get bursted down by an M4 in about a half second.  

- Suppression doesn't seem effective for anything but making you feel better with a couple of points. Suppressing snipers just led to them killing me anyway.  

- Maps felt far too small, with not nearly enough verticality to justify the size. If we're going to have small, urban meat grinder maps -- I'd prefer Pearl Market to Cairo.

- Liberation Peak feels imbalanced, and needs the central mountain addressed, and the push to F feels impossible. Some extra routes would be very welcome. Also the sheer number of scope glints will haunt my nightmares.  

- The HUD UI/UX is awful, cluttered and visually confusing.

- No server browser SUCKS, as does the lack of dedicated servers.  

- Queue issues with my party were common, forcing us to leave/rejoin the party and often have to manually join the game instead of automatically being added to the queue.

Overall I had fun, and found it to be a more cohesive experience than I had during the early 2042 days -- but it definitely could still use some adjustment.",10,1755578847.0,t3_1mk0tn7,False

The experience is overall still great, game slaps, definitely worth buying. I may be wrong on this list, so feel free to disagree.

1. Accessories make ARs too strong. Already in the beta, there are lots of assaults with full kit outcompeting every other weapon at every distance except extremely long range. I suggest nerfing the recoil reduction accessories significantly.
2. Helicopters feel very bad to drive. It seems everyone agrees with this one.
3. The open weapons system needs to be tweaked. Already in the beta, assault outcompets the scout class, since you can have a sniper rifle and a carbine as secondary. Basically, it seems like you always choose assault unless you want to destroy tanks or heal/support your team.
4. The closed weapons system is better, but still quite bad, since the LMG feels really bad with the combat medic class. In modern military and in every Battlefield, the machine gunner, or ""support,"" is very different from the combat medic. The game was clearly designed with open weapons in mind, giving you the possibility to create your own combat medic or machine gunner. I would suggest having an open weapons system, except you lock sniper rifles and LMGs to their respective class, since those are the classes that are most defined by their weapons. All the other weapons are open to everyone.
5. This subreddit doesn't like the smaller maps of the beta. Personally, I enjoy them quite a lot, but it's clear that the beta lacks the full battlefield experience.",22,1754581975.0,t3_1mk0tn7,False

I will say part of the problem with netcode on BF3 and any older game is that as playerbases start to dwindle, you start to get more and more high ping players. 

I've been in BF3 matches recently where like half the server is at 200ms+

BF3 would feel a lot better (although still not as good as a modern title) if the whole server was on 30-60ms. Conversely, BF6 would feel a lot worse if half the players on a US west server were from Brazil and Argentina.

The pacing in BF6 isn’t just about map size.

The game pacing of BF6, IMO, is the largest difference between BF6 and the older BF titles. And no, its not because of the movement.

As you mentioned, health regeneration is a big one. In BF6, there is a 5 second health regen delay followed by health regeneration that heals you up to full health within 5 seconds. That's a 10 second return time to full health, vs. the 36 seconds (16 second delay followed by health regeneration that takes 20 seconds to heal you up to full health) in BF3.

A strong suppression mechanic also slows the pacing of the game down. Inhibiting a player's ability to secure kills draws out engagements and results in more tactical gameplay. I know it is controversial, but a strong suppression mechanic in BF6 would work wonders at bringing it more in line with BF3/BF4 gameplay.

The target acquisition is another large offender on this front. In BF6, the game places red dots above enemy heads that are remotely near the center of your screen and also within \~35m of you, before they are even spotted. This allows you to follow up with a quick and easy manual spot, at which their locations would be communicated to the rest of your team in a similar manner. When more players are spotted, more engagements happen a lot quicker.

The pacing issues of BF6 are well described in this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mlf1n8/i\_got\_to\_max\_level\_and\_completed\_all\_challenges/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web3x&amp;utm\_name=web3xcss&amp;utm\_term=1&amp;utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mlf1n8/i_got_to_max_level_and_completed_all_challenges/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",7,1755623853.0,t3_1muirze,False

I still play regularly 3 and 4 after the beta, and gunplay is way way better on 3, and better on 4 . 

The movement is good in beta but I think a lot of people will definitely start overusing slides and jump and will become a bunnyhop shitfest pretty soon, and I'd hate that.

Sniper is way too easy in BF6, peak sniping was achieved in bf4 where it was the perfect balance between skill and easy to to.

I don't think vehicles are that bad in bf6, with just a little bit of tweaking they can be good.

But I agree that the assault doesn't make any sense currently, it was way better when it had the medic role. 

The only redeeming quality they could add to assault is to give it the C4 or temporary heal regen",1,1755627097.0,t3_1muirze,False

""Geometry buffer overflow. The GPU runs out of space for vertex data, ends up reading random memory, and suddenly meshes stretch, explode, or go totally haywire. It’s the shape itself breaking, not just textures.""

Edit added another comment to help explain:

""That’s what an overflow is. Location data for the vertexes of the triangles that make up the graphics is stored as floating point numbers.  There is only a certain range of numbers that the devs have defined for use. For a super simplified example, say that the game can only use the range 0 - 1000 for location data. If a calculation doesn’t get handled correctly, the number for the location ends up being outside of that range on either side aka an overflow. Then the game engine doesn’t know where the vertex should be for the miscalculated shapes which leads to what we see here. 

It doesn’t have anything to do with the strength of the GPU and sometimes it doesn’t have anything to do with how much memory the GPU has.""

Its not a GPU issue but a bug in the engine and trying to calculate the vertex. System can't, overflows, and problem gets worse is basically how I was explained about the issue.",38,1755591133.0,t3_1mua5dg,False

Obviously it’ll be lower because that’s how trends work for games, but how much lower?

It’s an interesting phenomenon we have in gaming now where certain titles get so much media hype you now have what is essentially a hive mind large cluster of people who are what I call “gaming tourists”.  As in this subset of people are often very casual gamers who really only care about playing “whatever the next big thing is”, and really couldn’t care less about the actual game itself.  Diablo 4 was a prime example.  Millions of non ARPG players flocked to it at launch because it was “the thing” like a cultural event and it was all over mainstream news. Now D4 is still a big game, but no where near launch levels.  BF6 could have a similar cycle.

Streamers obviously jump on these games because it’s farming subs &amp; views for money, that I get.  But what I don’t get is the actual “gamer tourists” who just follow the pack/these streamers blindly and jump from game to game, but are EXTREMELY vocal demanding changes to a game they don’t care about/no previous experience with the series and will drop like a hot rock the second it’s no longer “trending.”  Why?  

It would be like if you were a member of say a stamp collecting group and you all meet up the last 20 years at the same church basement every Friday night.  You have a good system, location, and generally everyone agrees on the stamp trading/collection processes/rules in your group.  Then one day stamp collecting starts trending on social media and obnoxious Gary barges into your meeting with 50 of his drunk friends and belligerently screams (while live streaming) “You all suck at stamp collecting, I’ve never done it but I’m gonna rip your meeting room apart, demand the church be converted into a TacoBell, and then I’m never collecting stamps again because now basket weaving is trending on X, peace out and don’t forget to like and subscribe chat!”  (And all of Gary’s drunk 50 followers slur and parrot in unison “Yeh we want what Gary says, Gary is God!”)",4,1755631704.0,t3_1muqv0x,False

If they don't make what streamers want from this game we have to support this one. Otherwise every one of the next FPS game will take example of this launch of BF6 and we will slowly but surely be cooked.

I also had criticism about beta but we know DICE is developing this game for years that there's 2 CoD games came out since this one announced and God knows from when they started laying the bricks of this game.

It's nothing like BF2042. They created something new, not like copy pasta CoD games we've seen since '19. If the launch will not be terrible I will stick with the DICE this time. I skipped their games since BF4 after Hardline announced I was like ""I'm not gonna play another Rainbow Six Vegas 2"" and started buying BF games for 2 years trying to catch up. I could say that they did a very decent job with the 5, 1 and 2042. And there's nothing else that can stratch that BF itch right now.

The goofy cosmetic stuff aside, 2042 feels so much more like BF than what I played during the BF6 beta.

Hiding on top of a shipping freighter with a javelin trying to lock onto a tank from a distance that’s capping C… a chopper unloading missiles on camping snipers up on top of the vehicle assembly building on Orbital… BASE jumping down from the cliffs to cap the extremely exposed objectives at the bottom of Exposure…

THAT feels a million times more like battlefield than what I played during the BF6 beta. I enjoyed BF6 but it played a lot less like battlefield than 2042 does.

The 2042 maps just pace things out way better. You can have a Brawler and a tank roll out together to cap a distant outpost and halfway through the cap a heli and an engineer with a javelin will show up to try to blow you up. 

THAT is battlefield imo.

BF6 has the potential to be better if they change the maps and have much bigger maps but right now I have no reason to believe it will have more battlefield DNA than 2042 due to the majority glut of tiny infantry focused maps.",38,1755604940.0,t3_1mubw3h,False

Gaming companies are being predatory, and taking advantage of non-neurotypical people to get them to do things they do not enjoy because of their drive to complete arbitrary achievements and collect purely cosmetic items. This boosts their numbers and engagement, and works well for their financials, but it hurts the quality of life of a lot people. As someone with mild OCD, I have to fight against this predatory engagement incentivization, so I've made a personal rule: if there is no in-game benefit to a thing, I treat it as an ""if it happens, it happens"" thing, and do not actively pursue it. In any game. It takes force of will for me NOT to grind for those things, but you have to draw lines somewhere. There's still lots and lots of in-game advantages to grind for.

I MAINLY play CoD, been playing since CoD4, stopped after MWIII (The newer one not the original).

I enjoyed the beta because it was refreshing to see a game where the pacing slows down a little and my contribution to objectives actually matters. Once the beta ended I wasn't satisfied so I booted up 2042 cuz it's free on psplus.

So, I've heard the stories that it's a terrible battlefield, but I ended up playing it all day. I enjoyed it, even if I mainly just focused on trying to unlock weapons I recognized (G36 and DSR1 supremacy). The operators made me roll my eyes a bit but their abilities all seemed pretty unassuming.

All you new players have no idea just how much the Battlefield community dogged and shit on DICE when they inplimented that shitty suppression rng bullets in BF3.

We're meant to be Soldiers, literally trained to hold our composure when bullets start flying. I don't care wtf is happening, I want my bullets to go where I'm aiming.

Guarantee that if DICE did go back to that horrible suppression effect, you'll be back here within the week dogging on the devs because suddenly you're losing gunfights because your bullets are missing what you're you're aiming at.

If you want a suppression effect, make it visual. Do not, under any circumstances, start fucking with how bullets work.",3,1755615957.0,t3_1mu3hso,False

You should not be rewarded for missing shots.

You should be at the disadvantage when challenging a sniper at range.

The other player should not be punished for holding their aim while taking fire, they are already taking the risk by presenting themselves as a target to be shot.

1). A “sticky” sensor your fire from a small gun, like the tracer gun from BFBC2.  You can fire it with accuracy up to medium range, stick it on ceilings or walls.  You can stick it to the side of an enemy tank and it will spot the tank plus all enemies/vehicles in a radius around it as it drives.  It can be destroyed, encouraging clever use and placement.

2). Give the standard ball more functionality.  For instance, it’s used for close range.  Not only does it spot, but it jams the other team from spotting you and your team within the radius.

I was mainly running SMG and using the spawn beacon to take objectives for beta as recon.  

I have mixed thoughts on a thrown or “shot” motion sensors (like parachute flares in BFV), they are fun, but it quickly becomes a meta where they’re always spam tossed by multiple recons into an objective from afar safely/no risk vs actually fighting/earning your way into the objective and then placing a sensor manually on the ground at your feet only.  Tossed or fired motion sensors greatly increase the tempo/speed of the matches overall as well, as again it’s far easier to spam spot more map via tossing or shooting multiple sensors, and the pace/tempo in BF6 is already very fast, do we need it faster?

It gets a little old when each objective is constantly fully spotted (by both sides mind you) on breakthrough because it’s far easier to spam toss/shoot multiple motion sensors safely from range vs manually placing only 1 available sensor down at your feet.  It works against attackers as well in a very negative way as you simply toss sensors over the “hill” and light up their entire frontline 24/7 spotted.",1,1755635734.0,t3_1muod9x,False

But I will never use the sniper rifles until they don’t feel like an absolute liability 99% of the time.

Ideas for improvements:
* Allow bolt actions to OHK either under or OVER certain ranges to the torso (stomach to head, not arms). If it’s under X meters, increase ADS time and decrease hip fire accuracy to prevent quick scoping. 

* Eliminate scope glint entirely. If I have to shoot you in the head while you sprint around the map aimlessly, the least the game can do is not tell you exactly where I am while I’m doing it.",0,1755632781.0,t3_1muod9x,False

I think battle passes can be fun but I'm not paying another 10 bucks for a premium battle pass experience (I don't know what BF6's plan is). Especially in a paid game. The FOMO that comes with battle passes is lame as well. If they are permanent progression options, I'm all for it.

My gripe with the premium style is that early on, it's a rip off. You're dropping extra money on lame stuff like a knife skin and dog tags with the hope that future DLCs will be both good and a better value through premium then buying them individually. You can easily get the rug pulled out from you and get mediocre DLCs or just have the DLCs cut short. Also a lot of the player base just won't buy it. DLC maps are hard to queue for when only 50% of the playerbase actually has them. In BF3, I still mostly played on launch maps vs the DLC ones I had out of luck mostly.

It all kinda sucks to be honest.",3,1755609761.0,t3_1muh39s,False

I understand the criticism around splitting the player base, but I guess no system is perfect. Sure, now we get free content, but in reality it is drip feeding maps one at a time, while creating the illusion of rich content with a bunch of meaningless skins and trinkets.

On the other hand back then we got map and weapon packs 3-4 times the size for 15$, around the same price for a seasonal battle pass.

We've had the alternative to map packs across all FPS games for years. At this point, I think people would be happy to go back to the paid expansion map packs.

They could seriously just sell map packs for 20 bucks and bundle in some cosmetics and XP boosts or make the map pack a bundle purchase with the seasonal battlepass for the brain rot crowd. They dump money into to MTX anyways, this is the best alternative I can think of.

I'm sure people would complain regardless, but this would be better than the ""freemium"" model that's been going on in every FPS for the past decade.

We used to get map packs every 2-3 months, that included 4 new maps, new guns, attachments, gadgets, vehicles, etc.

I don't want to hear about it splitting the playerbase anymore. Now we pay more for less support after launch and it hasn't paid off at all. If they sell a dumb fuck skin or BP boost or something with ALL of the other content in map packs, people will buy it.
